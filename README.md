# Datafold Demo Project

This repo contains a demo project suited to leveraging Datafold:
- dbt project that includes
  - raw data (implemented via [seed CSV files](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/seeds)) from a fictional app
  - a few downstream models, as shown in the project DAG below
- several 'master' branches, corresponding to the various supported cloud data platforms
  - `master` - 'primary' master branch, runs in Snowflake
  - `master-databricks` - 'secondary' master branch, runs in Databricks, is reset to the `master` branch daily or manually when needed via the `branch_replication.yml` workflow
  - `master-bigquery` - 'secondary' master branch, runs in BigQuery, is reset to the `master` branch daily or manually when needed via the `branch_replication.yml` workflow
  - `master-dremio` - 'secondary' master branch, runs in Dremio, is reset to the `master` branch daily or manually when needed via the `branch_replication.yml` workflow
- several GitHub Actions workflows illustrating CI/CD best practices for dbt Core
  - dbt PR job - is triggered on PRs targeting the `master` branch, runs dbt project in Snowflake
  - dbt prod - is triggered on pushes into the `master` branch, runs dbt project in Snowflake
  - dbt PR job (Databricks) - is triggered on PRs targeting the `master-databricks` branch, runs dbt project in Databricks
  - dbt prod (Databricks) - is triggered on pushes into the `master-databricks` branch, runs dbt project in Databricks
  - dbt PR job (BigQuery) - is triggered on PRs targeting the `master-bigquery` branch, runs dbt project in BigQuery
  - dbt prod (BigQuery) - is triggered on pushes into the `master-bigquery` branch, runs dbt project in BigQuery
  - dbt PR job (Dremio) - is triggered on PRs targeting the `master-dremio` branch, runs dbt project in BigQuery
  - dbt prod (Dremio) - is triggered on pushes into the `master-dremio` branch, runs dbt project in BigQuery
  - Apply monitors.yaml configuration to Datafold app - applies monitor-as-code configuration to Datafold application
  - raw data generation tool to simulate a data flow typical for real existing projects

## Running this project in the pre-configured Datafold environment

### Code management
All actual changes should be commited to the `master` branch, other `master-...` branches are supposed to be reset to the `master` branch daily.

### CI demo
! To ensure the integrity and isolation of GitHub Actions workflows, it is advisable to create pull requests (PRs) for different 'master' branches from distinct commits. This practice helps prevent cross-PR leakage and ensures that workflows run independently.

To demonstrate Datafold experience in CI on Snowflake - one needs to create PRs targeting the `master` branch.
- production schema in Snowflake: `demo.core`
- PR schemas: `demo.pr_num_<pr_number>`

To demonstrate Datafold experience in CI on Databricks - one needs to create PRs targeting the `master-databricks` branch.
- production schema in Databricks: `demo.default`
- PR schemas: `demo.pr_num_<pr_number>`

To demonstrate Datafold experience in CI on BigQuery - one needs to create PRs targeting the `master-bigquery` branch.
- production schema in BigQuery: `demo.default`
- PR schemas: `demo.pr_num_<pr_number>`

To demonstrate Datafold experience in CI on Dremio - one needs to create PRs targeting the `master-dremio` branch.
- production schema in BigQuery: `"Alexey S3".alexeydremiobucket.prod`
- PR schemas: `"Alexey S3".alexeydremiobucket.pr_num_<pr_number>`

### Data replication demo

To demonstrate Datafold functionality for data replication monitoring, a pre-configured Postgres instance (simulates transactional database) is populated with 'correct raw data' (`analytics.data_source.subscription_created` table); the `subscription__created` seed CSV file contains 'corrupted raw data'.

### BI apps demo
- Looker view, explore, and dashboard are connected to the `fct__monthly__financials` model in Snowflake, Databricks, and BigQuery.
  - Snowflake
    - `fct__monthly__financials` view
    - `fct__monthly__financials` explore
    - `Monthly Financials (Demo, Snowflake)` dashboard
  - Databricks
    - `fct__monthly__financials_databricks` view
    - `fct__monthly__financials_databricks` explore
    - `Monthly Financials (Demo, Databricks)` dashboard
  - BigQuery
    - `fct__monthly__financials_bigquery` view
    - `fct__monthly__financials_bigquery` explore
    - `Monthly Financials (Demo, BigQuery)` dashboard

## Running this project in a custom environment
To get up and running with this project:
1. Install dbt using [these instructions](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/installation).

2. Fork this repository.

3. Set up a profile called `demo` to connect to a data warehouse by following [these instructions](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/configure-your-profile). You'll need `dev` and `prod` targets in your profile.

4. Ensure your profile is setup correctly from the command line:
```bash
$ dbt debug
```

5. Create your `prod` models:
```bash
$ dbt build --profile demo --target prod
```

With `prod` models created, you're clear to develop and diff changes between your `dev` and `prod` targets.
